            <div class="panel-body">
        		<p>Over the years I have been presented with the challenge of generating
        		PDF files from data for invoices and other documents.. It's
        		really not as much fun as you would think.</p>
        		<p>I have googled the topic on more than one occasion and the solutions
        		mostly boil down to creating a custom script which uses a PDF library to
        		write content to a PDF file or using Latex or HTML and a PDF
        		converter to markup and generate the file. Latex is probably the way to go
        		if you have the expertise.</p>
        		<p>Converting HTML to PDF is hard to get right, especially when it comes
        		to documents which span multiple pages. Having repeated headers and footers
        		and splitting your content over multiple pages correctly is another complex challenge. PDFUnicorn
        		is not a "web to PDF" converter.</p> 
        		<p>PDFUnicorn is my attempt to simplify the process of generating PDF
        		documents to enable businesses to better serve their customers and to
        		better represent their business.</p>
        		<p>regards,</p>
