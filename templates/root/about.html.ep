        		<p>Over the years I have been presented with the challenge of generating
        		PDF documents from data on a server for invoices and packing slips.</p>
        		<p>It's not a fun thing to do.</p>
        		<p>I have googled the topic on more than one occasion and the solutions
        		mostly boil down to creating a custom script which uses a PDF library or
        		using <a href="http://latex-project.org/">Latex</a> or HTML and a PDF
        		converter.</p>
        		<p>Latex is possibly one way to go if you have the expertise.</p>
        		<p>Converting HTML to PDF is hard to get right, especially when it comes
        		to documents which span multiple pages. Having repeated headers and footers
        		and spliting your content correctly is complex if possible at all.</p> 
        		<p>PDFUnicorn is my attempt to simplify the process of generating PDF
        		documents to enable businesses to better serve their customers and
        		add a bit of class to the documents they create.</p>
        		<p>Ultimately I'd like to see SAAS and PAAS companies enable their clients
        		to quickly and easily fully customise the invoices and other documents sent
        		to their customers. Customisations could range from adding a logo or leagally
        		required information, to complex item descriptions in invoices or customised
        		item documentation or conditions.</p>
