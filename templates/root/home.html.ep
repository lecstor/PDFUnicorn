                    <p>At it's core, PDFUnicorn is a web service for making PDF files.</p>
                    
                    <p>PDF files can be created directly from source documents, or from data
                    applied to custom templates.</p>
                    
                    <p>The markup language is intentionally simple to allow you to start creating
                    templates and documents as quickly and easily as possible.</p>
                    
                    <p>Document content is securely sent from your server to ours enabling private
                    customer text and images to be included without allowing remote access to your
                    server and content.</p>

            <h3>Why?</h3>
            <p>Over the years I have been presented with the challenge of creating custom solutions for generating
            PDF files from data for invoices, packing slips, and assorted other documents.. It's
            really not as much fun as you would think.. ;)</p>
            <p>
                The solutions available include:
                <ul>
                    <li>develop a custom solution using one of a few popular PDF libraries</li>
                    <li>use Latex to design documents and generate them in PDF format</li>
                    <li>use an HTML-to-PDF program</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Latex is probably the way to go if you have the expertise.
                It gives you full control of the generated documents and allows you to take
                advantage of most of the features available to the PDF format.
            </p> 
            <p>
                Converting HTML to PDF is hard to get right, especially when it comes to documents
                which span multiple pages. HTML was designed to display single pages of varying size.
                It has no concept of pages limited to a set size or having to split up content and
                repeat sections of it across multiple pages.
            </p> 
            <p>
                PDFUnicorn is my attempt to simplify the process of generating PDF documents and to
                save you the time and costs associated with creating and maintaining your own solution.
