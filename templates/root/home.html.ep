            <p>So you've been tasked with producing PDF documents on demand, from your server, with custom data, in real time.</p>
            <p>You've looked at the option of web-to-pdf converters, but you've seen the issues others have had with page breaks, repeated headers, private content, and more.</p>
            <p>Maybe you need to include images and have your documents be print quality.</p>
            <p>Or you need to include content which is not publicly accessible, so you think a web service is out of the question.</p> 
            <p>You've come to the right place!</p>

            <p>PDFUnicorn is a web service for creating PDF files.</p>
            
            <p>PDF files can be created directly from source documents, or from data
            applied to custom templates.</p>
            
            <p>The markup language is intentionally simple to allow you to start creating
            templates and documents as quickly and easily as possible.</p>
            
            <p>Document content is securely sent from your server to ours enabling private
            customer text and images to be included without allowing remote access to your
            server and content.</p>
            
            <p>Document images can be uploaded at print quality resolutions to create the
            best looking documents possible.</p>
            
            <p>This is not a html2pdf conversion service, it is designed as a simple, reliable
            way to create multi-page documents.</p>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>Over the years I have been presented with the challenge of creating custom solutions for generating
            PDF files from data for invoices, packing slips, and assorted other documents.. It's
            really not as much fun as you would think.. ;)</p>
            <p>
                The solutions available include:
                <ul>
                    <li>develop a custom solution using one of a few popular PDF libraries</li>
                    <li>use Latex to design documents and generate them in PDF format</li>
                    <li>use an HTML-to-PDF program</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Latex is probably the way to go if you have the expertise.
                It gives you full control of the generated documents and allows you to take
                advantage of most of the features available to the PDF format.
            </p> 
            <p>
                Converting HTML to PDF is hard to get right, especially when it comes to documents
                which span multiple pages. HTML was designed to display single pages of varying size.
                It has no concept of pages limited to a set size or having to split up content and
                repeat sections of it across multiple pages.
            </p> 
            <p>
                PDFUnicorn is my attempt to simplify the process of generating PDF documents and to
                save you the time and costs associated with creating and maintaining your own solution.

            <p>I want to build a solution to solve your PDF generation problems. I want to keep it as simple
            as possible to use while allowing you to create the documents you need, the way you want them.</p>
            <p>I have a long list of features I could implement, but I want to hear from you, so I'm not just
            creating another overly complicated solution to what should be a simple problem.</p>
            <p>PDFUnicorn is not built on someone else's PDF generator. I can improve and modify any and all
            of the layout features that turn markup into documents.</p>
